##  Built With
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Tape for testing

#### Lessons learned...:

- DeepEquals is needed to check inside an array or object.
- A key is needed to call an item in a object.
- Learn how to use array methods on objects (concat, filter and map).
- IIFE how it works
- How to use => function 
- How a spread operator works 
- How to use DOM manipulation
- Use ElementChild 

#### Issues we faced during this project:

- Understanding the code we started with
- Write proper test statements
- Using button to marktodo instead of checkbox
- Wrapping heads around the MVC setup (separation of logic and view) in this project

## Notes and stuff
- [IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)
- Tested with tape


## Still todo on the todo...ironically...
- Add the sort function
- up our emoji game
- be more disciplined with testing (i.e. let it drive our development, rather than just getting on with it)
